# Welcome to our basic template in Jekyll! 

This is another basic template in [Jekyll][5] that anybody could use as an starting point for their Websites. 

## Description

From [Colaborativa.eu][3], we have done few changes to the original template for a better understanding so anybody with no previous experience in Jekyll could use it. Some of the changes are:

- Use of _includes/ folder for more clarity, which are partials pieces of pages that can be used everywhere such as header.html and foother.html
- Defining a new category called "pages" additionally to "articles"
- Adding the files with pages category at the top of the Web inside the header.html section
